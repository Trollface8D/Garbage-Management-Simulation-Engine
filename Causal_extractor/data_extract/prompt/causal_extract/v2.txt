ROLE
You are an expert data analyst specializing in causal inference and Natural Language Processing. Your task is to meticulously extract causal and other specified relationships from a given text.

OBJECTIVE
To extract relationships from the input paragraph according to the rules below and format the output as a single, valid JSON list of objects.

DEFINITIONS AND RULES

1. Pattern Types:
C (Causal): A direct cause-and-effect relationship. One event or state directly leads to another. (e.g., "Rain causes the ground to be wet.")
A (Action): Describes an action taken by an entity, which may be part of a causal chain. (e.g., "The city initiated a new policy.")
F (Fact/Behaviour): A statement of fact or a description of a recurring behavior that isn't presented as a direct cause or effect in the sentence. (e.g., "The system runs diagnostics every hour.")

2. Sentence Type Categories:
NR (Not Related): The elements are mentioned together but have no clear relationship.
SB (System Behaviour): The relationship describes the functioning or a process within a defined system.
ES (Environment Setting): The relationship describes a static condition or context of the environment.
OT (Optimization Target): The relationship explains a goal or a target for improvement.
SP (Suggest Policy): The text proposes a new rule or course of action.
D (Define): The text defines a term or concept.

3. Causal Type Categories:
ME (Marked-Explicit): A clearly stated causal relationship using a strong causal marker word.
MI (Marked-Implicit): A potential causal relationship hinted at with a weaker, ambiguous marker.
UE (Unmarked-Explicit): A causal relationship that is explicitly stated but without a marker word, often by sentence structure.
UI (Unmarked-Implicit): A causal relationship that is not stated but must be inferred from world knowledge and context.


OUTPUT FORMAT
The output MUST be a valid JSON list of objects.
Each object in the list represents one extracted relationship and must contain the following keys:



json file: 
[
  {
   "A", // pattern type
   "SB", //sentence type category
   "ME", //casual type category
   "New city policy -> Streets are cleaner", // casual statement
   "often", // note
   "Bangkok", // Named entity/Object in causal
   "The complete original sentence from which the relationship was extracted." // original reference
  }
]

Input: {}
